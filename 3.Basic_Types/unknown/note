unknown is similar to any but safter alternative to any. because it forces type checking before you use the value.

You can assign any value to unknown, but you cannot perform operations on it without first narrowing the type.

let value: unknown;
value = "Hello"; // ✅ Allowed
value = 42;      // ✅ Allowed
value = true;    // ✅ Allowed

let str: string = value; // ❌ Error: Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'string'

if (typeof value === "string") {
  let str: string = value; // ✅ Now it's allowed
  console.log(str.toUpperCase()); // ✅ Safe to use
}


Use any only if you need complete flexibility and don’t care about type safety (not recommended).
Use unknown when you expect a value to be dynamic but want to enforce proper type checking before using it.
